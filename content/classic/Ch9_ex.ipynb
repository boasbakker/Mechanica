    "1. We can consider the shooting as a collision. Bullets don't bounce back, they penetrate a body. So the victim 'gains' maximum momentum if the bullet stays in the body. Then according to conservation of momentum, we have for this inelastic collision:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_b v_b + M_v \\cdot 0 = \\left ( m_b + M_v \\right ) U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the velocity of the victim after being shot is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U = \\frac{m_b}{m_b + M_v} v_b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the shooter a similar argument holds: before the shot, bullet & shooter have zero momentum. After firing, the bullet has velocity $v_b$. Thus conservation of momentum requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = m_b v_b + M_s U_s$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we find for the velocity of the shooter:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_s = -\\frac{m_b}{M_s} v_b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: as the mass of the bullet is negligible compared to that of a person both shooter and victim have similar velocities. As their mass is comparable, it is clear: from a physics point of view, if the victim is blown backward, than also the shooter is.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the above we get, using $m_b \\approx 10 \\cdot 10^{-3}$kg, $v_b \\approx 500$m/s and $M_v \\approx 70$kg:\n",
