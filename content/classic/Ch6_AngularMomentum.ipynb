    "From experience we know that if we want to unscrew a bottle, lift a heavy object on one side, try to unscrew a screw, we better use 'leverage'.\n",

    ":alt: A long beam is used as a lever to lift a heavy object. The pivot point is located off-center, closest to the heavy object. Force FL points upward at the beam's end where the heavy object is place. Force FS is exerted on the other end of the beam. \n",

    ":align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "Lifting is easier using leverage.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With a relatively small force $F_S$, we can lift the side of a heavy object. The key concept to use here is torque, which in words is loosely formulated: apply the force using a long arm and the force seems to be magnified. The torque is then force multiplied by arm: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Tau = \Text{Force} \\ \\text{times} \\ \text{arm}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This is, of course, too sloppy for physicists. We need strict, formal definitions. So, we put the above into a mathematical definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important} torque\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\Tau} \\equiv \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is: torque (or krachtmoment in Dutch) is the cross product of 'arm' as a vector(!) and the force. We notice a few peculiarities.\n",
    "1. like force, torque is a vector. That is: it has a magnitude and a direction. In principle: three components.\n",
    "1. its direction is perpendicular to the force vector $\\vec{F}$ *and* perpendicular to the arm $\\vec{r}$.\n",
    "1. the arm is not a number: it is a vector!\n",
    "\n",
    "We further know from experience that we can balance torques, like we can balance forces. Rephrased: the net effect of more than one force is found by adding all the forces (as vectors!) and using the net force in Newtons Second Law: $m\\vec{a} = \\sum \\vec{F}_i = \\vec{F}_{net}$. From Newtons First Law, we immediately infer: if $\\sum \\vec{F}_i = \\vec{F}_{net}=0$ then the object moves at constant velocity. We can move with the object at this speed and conclude that it from this perspective has zero velocity: it doesn't move, i.e. it is in equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same holds for torque: we can work with the sum of all torques that act on an object: $\\sum \\vec{\\Tau}_i = \\vec{\\Tau}_{net}$. And if this sum is zero, the object is in equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a catch: using torques requires that we are much more explicit and precise about the choice of our origin. Why? The reason is in the 'arm'. That is only defined if we provide an origin. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The seesaw and torque\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example (simple in the sense that we are all familiar with it): the seesaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/ch6_SeeSaw1.svg\n",
    ":label: fig:ch6_SeeSaw1.svg\n",
    ":width: 200px\n",
    ":alt: An adult (left) and a child (right) are sitting on a balanced seesaw. \n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "An adult (left) and a child (right) on a seesaw. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that the adult -seesawing with the child- should sit much closer to the pivot point than the child. That is: we assume that the mass of the adult is greater than that of the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's turn this picture into one that captures the essence and includes the necessary physical quantities, and then draw a free-body diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/ch6_SeeSaw2.svg\n",
    ":label: fig:ch6_SeeSaw2.svg\n",
    ":width: 400px\n",
    ":alt: The same seesaw is drawn, with the adult replaced by a large box of mass M and the child replaced by a small box of mass m. Th adult is sitting at a distance L from the pivot point and the child is a distance l away from the pivot point. \n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "Free-body diagram of the seesaw and the masses.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What did we **draw**?  \n",
    "1) The force of gravity acting on the two masses $M$ and $m$. That is obvious: without forces nothing will happen and there is nothing to be analyzed.  \n",
    "2) The 'reaction forces' from the seesaw on both masses. Why? If the seesaw is in equilibrium, then each of the masses is in equilibrium and the sum of forces on each mass must be zero.  \n",
    "3) The distance of each of the masses to the pivot point. Why? Leverage! The heavy $M$ must be closer to the pivot point the get equilibrium.  \n",
    "4) An origin $O$. Why? We need a point to measure the 'arm', 'leverage', from.   \n",
    "5) The $z$-coordinate. Why? We deal with forces in the vertical direction. Hence a coordinate, a direction that we all use, is handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**  \n",
    "Time for a first analysis: what keeps this seesaw in equilibrium?  \n",
    "1) The sum of forces on each of the masses is zero. As gravity pulls them down, the seesaw must exert a force of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction. These are the green forces.\n",
    "2) With this idea we have the masses in equilibrium, but not necessarily the seesaw. Why? We did not consider forces on the seesaw. Which are these: (a) the reaction force (i.e. the N3 pair) of the green force from the seesaw on mass $M$. We did not draw that! Similarly, for the mass $m$.  \n",
    "3) Now that we focus on the seesaw itself: this is in equilibrium (that is given), but there are two forces acting on it in the negative $z$-direction as we found in (2). Even if we consider the mass of the seesaw: that will not help, gravity will pull it downwards. What did we forget? The force at the pivot point, of course! The pivot will exert an upward force, preventing the seesaw from falling down. For simplicity, we assume that the seesaw has zero mass. Thus, there are three forces acting on it: $-Mg$, $-mg$, $F_p$ with $F_p - Mg - mg = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's redraw, now concentrating on the forces on the seesaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/ch6_SeeSaw3.svg\n",
    ":label: fig:ch6_SeeSaw3.svg\n",
    ":alt: The force FP at the pivot point of the seesaw is pointing upward. \n",

    ":align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "Free-body diagram of the seesaw.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis part 2**  \n",
    "We know that the seesaw is in equilibrium, thus\n",
    "$$F_p - Mg - mg = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees that the seesaw does not change its velocity, and as it does not move at some time $t_0$, it doesn't move for all $t>t_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this doesn't guarantee that the seesaw doesn't rotate around the pivot point. For that we need that the 'leverages' on the left and right side 'perform' the same.  \n",
    "Making this precise: the torques exerted on the seesaw must also equate to zero.  \n",
    "We have 3 forces, thus 3 torques: $-Mg$ with arm $L$, $-mg$ with arm $l$ and $F_p$ with arm zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to be even more precise: torque is a vector and it is made as a cross product of the vector 'arm' and the force.   \n",
    "We have already drawn an $x$-coordinate in the figure, that will allow us to write the 'arm' as a vector. After all, we need to evaluate the cross product $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$. We do that for the three forces, starting on the left:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\Tau}_1 = -L\\hat{x} \\times (-Mg)\\hat{z} = MLg \\, \\hat{x} \\times \\hat{z} = MLg \\left ( -\\hat{y} \\right ) = -MLg \\, \\hat{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used here, that the cross product of $\\hat{x}$ with $\\hat{z}$ is equal to $-\\hat{y}$ with $\\hat{y}$ the unit vector in the $y$-direction pointing into the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly for the force coming from the small mass $m$ on the right side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\Tau}_2 = l\\hat{x} \\times (-mg)\\hat{z} = -mlg \\, \\hat{x} \\times \\hat{z} = mlg \\, \\hat{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the torque from the force exerted by the pivot point:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\Tau}_3 = 0\\hat{x} \\times F_p\\hat{z} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we evaluate the total torque:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{\\Tau}_1 + \\vec{\\Tau}_2 +\\vec{\\Tau}_3 = ( mlg - MLg )\\hat{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the seesaw not to start rotating, we must have that the torque is zero and thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum \\vec{\\Tau}_i = 0 \\Rightarrow mlg = MLg \\rightarrow \\frac{m}{M} = \\frac{L}{l}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A result we expected: the greater mass should be closer to the pivot point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different origin\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, so good. But what if we had chosen the origin not at the pivot point, but somewhere to the left? Then all 'arm' will change length. And all torques will be different. Wouldn't that make $\\sum \\vec{\\Tau}_i \\neq 0$?  \n",
    "No, it wouldn't! Let's just do it and recalculate. In the figure below, we have moved the origin to the left end of the seesaw. The distance from the heavy mass to the origin is $\\Lambda$ (green arrow).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/ch6_SeeSaw4.svg\n",
    ":label: fig:ch6_SeeSaw4.svg\n",
    ":width: 400px\n",
    ":alt: A new coordinate system is added at the left-most end of the seesaw. The distance from the new origin to the center of mass of the adult is maked by a green line. \n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "Free-body diagram with the origin located at the seesaw's end.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We still have that the sum of forces is zero. But what about the sum of torques? Obviously, the choice of the origin can not affect the seesaw: it is still in balance, regardless of our choice of the origin. Let's see if that is correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum \\vec{\\Tau}_i = \\Lambda \\hat{x} \\times -Mg\\hat{z} + \\left ( \\Lambda + L \\right ) \\times F_p\\hat{z} + \\left ( \\Lambda + L + l \\right )\\hat{x} \\times -mg\\hat{z} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have drawn the three unit vectors $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$ in the figure. We will use again: $\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{z} = -\\hat{y}$. This simplifies the torque equation above to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum \\vec{\\Tau}_i = \\left [ Mg\\Lambda - (\\Lambda + L ) F_p + mg( \\Lambda + L + l ) \\right ]\\hat{y} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly more complicated than the expression we had with the first choice of the origin. Moreover, the force from the pivot point shows up in our expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, we have equilibrium. Hence: $F_p - Mg - mg = 0 \\Rightarrow F_p = Mg + mg$. We substitute this into our torque equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{split}\n",
    "\\sum \\vec{\\Tau}_i &= \\left [ Mg\\Lambda - (\\Lambda + L ) (Mg + mg)) + mg( \\Lambda + L + l ) \\right ] \\hat{y} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\left [ Mg(\\Lambda - (\\Lambda + L ))  + mg( - (\\Lambda + L ) + \\Lambda + L + l ) \\right ]\\hat{y}\\\\\n",
    "&= \\left [ -MgL  + mgl \\right ]\\hat{y}\n",
    "\\end{split}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is exactly the same expression as we found before. So, indeed, the choice of the origin doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "For equilibrium we need that the sum of torques is zero: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_i \\vec{\\Tau}_i = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Angular Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "From our seesaw example we learn: the seesaw can only be in equilibrium if the sum of torques is zero. What if this sum is non-zero? That is, a net torque operates on the seesaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the seesaw will rotate and in order to balance it, we have to shift at least one of the masses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In which direction will it rotate? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before answering: first we need to think about **direction of rotation**. Does it have direction and if so: how do we make clear what that is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again the seesaw will give guidance. Suppose we remove the smaller mass all together. Then, it is obvious: the 'heavy' left side will rotate to the ground and the light right side upwards. From the point of view we are standing: the seesaw will rotate counter clockwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the corkscrew rule or right hand rule to give that a direction: rotate a corkscrew clockwise and the screw will move into the cork away from you; rotate a corkscrew counter clockwise and it will move out of the cork, towards you. Of course, in stead of a corkscrew you can think of a screwdriver or a water tap: closing is rotating 'clock wise, opening the tap is counter clockwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/ch6_RotatingDirection.svg\n",
    ":label: fig:ch6_SeeSaw5.svg\n",
    ":alt: A black vector points right and up. The rotation is shown as a counter clockwise arrow around the vector. \n",
    ":width: 100px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation is given by the black arrow. You can find it by using the corkscrew rule: rotating a corkscrew as the blue arrow indicates gives that the screw moves forward like the black arrow.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can define the direction of rotation better than via clock or counter clock wise. In our seesaw example, we will say: if the seesaw rotates clockwise, its rotation is described by a vector that points in the positive $y$-direction as given in the figure, that is pointing into the paper (or screen).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can couple this to the direction of the torque. We saw -taking the origin at the pivot point- two torques acting on the seesaw. The large mass has its torque pointing in the negative $y$-direction: it points out of the screen/paper. And this torque tries to rotate the seesaw counter clockwise. On the other hand, the small mass has a torque pointing in the positive $y$-direction which is in line with it trying to rotate the seesaw clockwise.    \n",
    "Which of the two is 'strongest' determines the direction of rotation: if $MgL > mgl$ then the net torque is in the minus-$y$ direction. That is, the torque of the larger mass is more negative than the smaller one is positive: $-MgL + mgl <0 $ and the net torque points towards us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity that goes with this, is the angular momentum. It is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "```{important} angular momentum\n",

First $\\vec{r}$ then $\\vec{p}$. If you do it the other way around, you unwillingly have introduced a minus sign that should not be there.  \n",

But at the same time, due to action = - reaction, the wheel exerts also a torque on the student. But in the opposite direction.

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words: a force is central if it points always into the direction of the origin or exactly in the opposite direction.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose, a particle of mass $m$ is subject to a central force. Then we can immediately infer that its angular momentum is a constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{if } \\vec{F} = |\\vec{F}(\\vec{r})| \\hat{r} \\text{ then } \\frac{d\\vec{l}}{dt} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} =  |\\vec{F}(\\vec{r})| \\vec{r} \\times \\hat{r} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have used that $\\vec{r}$ and $\\hat{r}$ are always parallel so their cross-product is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is rather trivial, but has a very important consequence: a particle that moves under the influence of a central force, moves with a constant angular momentum (vector!) and must move in a plane. It can not get out of that plane. Thus its motion is at maximum a 2-dimensional problem. We can always use a coordinate system, such that the motion of the particle is confined to only two of the three coordinates, e.g. we can choose our $x,y$ plane such that the particle moves in it and thus always has $z(t) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this so? Why does the fact that the angular momentum vector is a constant immediately imply that the particle motion is in a plane? The argumentation goes as follows.  \n",
    "Imagine a particle that moves under the influence of a central force. At some point in time it will have position $\\vec{r}_0$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_0$. Neither of them is zero. We will assume that $\\vec{r}_0$ and $\\vec{p}_0$ are not parallel (in general they will not be). Thus they define a plane. Due to the cross-product $\\vec{l}_0 = \\vec{r}_0 \\times \\vec{p}_0$ is perpendicular to this plane.  \n",
    "A little time later, say $\\Delta t$ later, both position and momentum will have changed. Since the force is central, the force is also in the plane defined by the initial position and momentum. Thus the change of momentum is in that plane as well: $\\vec{p} (t + \\Delta t) = \\vec{p} (t) + \\vec{F} \\Delta t$. The right hand side is completely in our plane. And thus, the new momentum is also in the plane. But that means that the velocity is also in the same plane. An thus the new position $\\vec{r} (t + \\Delta t) = \\vec{r}(t) + \\frac{\\vec{p}}{m} \\Delta t$ must be in the same plane as well. We can repeat this argument for the next time and thus see, that both momentum and position can not get out of the plane. This is, of course, fully in agreement with the fact that $\\vec{l} = const$ for a central force.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Central forces: conservative or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further restrict our class of central forces:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{  if  } \\vec{F}(\\vec{r}) = f(r) \\hat{r} \\text{  then F is central and conservative} $$\n",

If that is the case, the force is automatically conservative and a potential does exist.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the concept of central forces and potential energy play a pivotal role in understanding the motion of celestial bodies, like our earth revolving the sun. \n",
    "The planetary motion is an example of using the concept of central forces. It is, however, also an example in its own right.

    "\n",
    "We find ourselves back in the Late Renaissance, that is around 1550-1600 AD. In Europe, the first signs of the scientific revolution can be found. Copernicus proposed his heliocentric view of the solar system. Galilei used his telescope to study the planets and found further evidence for the heliocentric idea. In Denmark, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) made astronomical observations with data of unprecedented precision. He did so without the telescope as the first records of telescopes date back to around 1608 AD. \n",

    "\n",
    "Brahe initially studied law, but developed a keen interest in astronomy. He was heavily influenced by the solar eclipse of August 21$^{st}$ in 1560. The eclipse had been predicted via the theory of celestial motion at that time. However, the prediction was off by a day. This led Brahe to the conclusion that in order to advance celestial science, many more and much better observations were needed. He devoted much of his time in achieving this. One of his best assistants was his younger sister, Sophie.\n",
    "\n",
    "On November 11$^{th}$ 1572, Brahe observed a bright, new star in the constellation Cassiopeia (it consists of five bright stars forming a M or W). That was another event that made him decide to spend his days (or rather nights &#128522; ) gathering astronomical data. The general believe in those days was still that everything beyond the Moon was eternal, never changing. So, this new star, that all in a sudden appeared, must be closer to the earth than the Moon itself. Brahe set out to measure its daily parallax against the five stars of Cassiopeia. But he didn't observe any parallax. Consequently, the new star's position had to be farther out than the Moon and the other planets that did show daily parallax. Moreover, Brahe kept measuring for months and still found no parallax. That meant that this new star was even further out than the known planets that show no daily parallax but did so for periods of month. Brahe reached the conclusion that this new 'thing' thus could not be yet another planet, but that it was a star. Another nail to the coffin of the Aristotle view. Brahe wrote a small book about it, called De Nova Stella (published in 1573). He uses the term 'nova' for a new star. We see this back in our name for the phenomenon observed by Brahe: we call it a supernova. By now it is known that this new star, this supernova is some 8,000 light years away from us. Brahe was upset by those who denied the new findings. In his introduction of De Nova Stella he writes (given here in our modern words): \"Oh, coarse characters. Oh, blind spectators of heaven\". The work and the booklet made his name in Europe as a leading scientist and astronomer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the winter of 1577-1578 a comet, known as the \"Great Comet\" appeared in the skies. It was observed by many all over the globe (from the Aztecs in the America's via European researchers to the Arabic world, India all the way to Japan). Brahe made thousands of recordings, some simultaneously done in Denmark (close to Copenhagen) and Prague. That way, Brahe could establish that the comet was much beyond the Moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of his life, Brahe moved to Prague to become the official imperial astronomer under the protection of Rudolf II, the Holy Roman Emperor. In the later part of his life, Brahe had Johannes Kepler as his assistant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler was 6 years old when the Great Comet appeared in the sky. He recorded in his writings that his mother had taken him to a high place to look at it. At the age of nine, he witnessed a lunar eclipse in which the Moon is in the Earth shadow, darkening it and turning quite red. As a child he suffered from smallpox making his vision weak and limited ability to use his hands. This made it difficult for him to make astronomical observations. It pushed him to mathematics. But there he was confronted with the Ptolemaic and the Copernican view on planetary motion. Kepler became a math professor at the Protestant Stiftsschüle in Graz. He wrote his ideas about the universe, following the thoughts of Copernicus in a book, that was read by Tycho Brahe. This brought him into contact with Brahe. In 1600 Kepler and his family moved to Prague as a consequence of political and religious oppression. He was appointed as assistant to Brahe and worked with Brahe on a new star catalogue and planetary tables. Brahe died unexpectedly on October 24th 1601. Two days later, Kepler was appointed as his successor. \n",

    "Kepler worked on a heliocentric version of the universe and in the period 1609-1619 published his first two laws. With these, he changed from trying circular orbits to other closed ones, to arrive at an elliptical one for Mars. That one was in very good agreement with the Brahe data, much better than had been achieved before. Kepler realized that the other planets might also be in elliptical orbits. In comparison with Copernicus he stated: the planetary orbits are not circles with epi-circles. Instead it are ellipses. Secondly, The sun is not at the center of the orbit, but in one of the focal points of the ellipse. Thirdly, the speed of a planet is not a constant.\n",

    "    1. Thus, the angular momentum is conserved.\n",
    "    1. The orbit is in a plane: we deal with a 2-dimensional problem.\n",
    "- The force is conserved: a potential exists.\n",

    "Based on these, we will derive Kepler's laws only using Newtonian Mechanics. This is easiest in polar coordinates $(r, \\phi )$. However, in this course we do not deal with these coordinates. We will thus give a coarse overview of the steps that should be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we notice, is that the constant angular momentum provides a constraint on the relation between $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{p}$. This constraint can be used to rewrite the kinetic energy $E_{kin} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$ into $E_{kin} = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{l^2}{2mr^2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? The coordinate $r$ is the distance from the sun to the earth. Its time derivative $(\\dot{r} = \\frac{dr}{dt} = v_r)$ is the velocity of the earth away from the sun. This is called the radial component of the velocity. {numref}`fig:Vradial.svg` illustrates this.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that $\\dot{r}$ tells us if we are moving such that we are getting closer to the sun or further away. But it does not tells us how we move 'around' the sun.

    "We already saw that in this case gravity is a conservative force. The potential energy is found by solving $V(r) = -\\int_{r_{ref}}^r \\vec{F}_g \\cdot d\\vec{r} $. We can plug in $\\vec{F}_g = - G \\frac{mM}{r^2} \\hat{r}$. Thus only the radial coordinate is of importance in the inner product in the integral. Furthermore, we will use as reference boundary: $\\infty$. Thus, the potential energy is:\n",

However, we will not do that. Reason: it is complicated and we don't need it! What we need is to find what kind of figure the trajectory is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to bring the number of unknowns in the energy equation down from two to one. For that, we use $E_{kin} = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{l^2}{2mr^2}$. \n",
