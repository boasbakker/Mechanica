From Newton 2, we immediately infer that if the two forces cancel each other, then the particle will move with a constant velocity. Hence, its kinetic energy stays constant.

Hence, the interior of our curve is full of squares. We are not only computing the parts along the curve, but also along the sides of alle curves.

Than we have at least the green part of our $∮ \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}$ done in the right direction. Hence, we compute $\\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}$ along the right side of the green square.
