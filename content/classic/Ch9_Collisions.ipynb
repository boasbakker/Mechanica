    "## What are collisions?\n",
    "In daily life we do understand what a collision is: the bumping of two objects into each other. From a physics point of view, we see it slightly different. The objects don't have to touch. It is sufficient if they undergo a mutual interaction *'with a beginning and an end'*. What do we mean by this? \n",

    "Collision of two particles.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the mutual interaction means that the objects interact with each other through a mutual force, i.e. a force (pair) that obeys Newton's third law.  \n",
    "Secondly, we assume that this force works over a small distance only. Or re-phrased we will only consider the situation before the objects feel the force and compare that to after they have felt it. We don't bother about the details of the motion of the objects *during* their interaction. Hence, when we depict a collision as in {numref}`fig:ch9_collision.svg`, we usually draw the situation before the collision, then some kind of 'comic way' of showing the collision and finally we draw the outcome of the collision, so after the interaction. In many cases, people leave the middle part out of their drawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two principle types of collisions to distinguish: *elastic* and *inelastic* collisions. For an elastic collision the kinetic energy is conserved, whereas for an inelastic that is not the case. In the latter case, energy can be converted into deformation or heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the objects interact under the influence of their mutual interaction, we have conservation of momentum:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_i \\vec{p}_i^{before} = \\sum_i \\vec{p}_i^{after}\n",

    "\n",
    "Now use your other hand to flick the third coin strongly, aiming to hit the middle coin and cause a collision.\n",

    "\n",
    "For an elastic collision the kinetic energy is conserved by definition (next to the conservation of momentum). That is the sum of the kinetic energy before the collision is the same as the sum after the collision. This type of collision is also called *hard-ball collision*: as with colliding billiard balls no energy is dissipated into heat or deformation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The answer is yes: there ought to be 2 solutions. Where is the second one?\n",
    "Note that when dividing the two equations, we have to make sure that we do not divide by 0. It is very well possible that we do so: suppose $u' = 0$, then also $2v-v' = 0$ and we can not do the division. But what does that mean: $u'=0$ and $2v-v'=0$? Well, of course, then we have after the collision that the incoming particle $2m$ still has velocity $2v$ and the other particle $3m$ is still at rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "In retrospect: of course this must be one of the solutions to the problem. We haven't specified anything about the interaction force. But suppose it is absent, that is, the particles don't interact at all. Then of course the situation before the collision (a bit strange calling this a collision, but anyway), will still be present after the 'collision'. If nothing happens to the particles, then obviously the sum of the momentum as well as of the kinetic energy stays the same. This actually provides a great check of your work: do you recover the initial conditions?\n",
