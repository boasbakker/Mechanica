    "# Two Body Problem: Kepler revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton must have realized that his analysis of the Kepler laws was not 100% correct. After all, the sun is not fixed in space and even though its mass is much larger than any of the planets revolving it, it will have to move under the influence of the gravitational force by the planets. Take for example, the sun and earth as our system. By the account of Newton's third law, the Earth exerts also a force on the Sun. Therefore, the Sun has to move as well; thus, we must revisit the Earth-Sun analysis and incorporate that the Sun isn't fixed in space.  \n",

Furthermore, if this fictitious mass has velocity $\\vec{V}$, we can also assign a position to it. After all, $\\vec{V} = \\frac{d\\vec{R}}{dt}$, which gives us the recipe for the position $\\vec{R}$.\n",

    "2)  If the particles are separate by a small distance, we would like to have the fictitious particle somewhere in between the two. Moreover, if the two particles are identical, it makes sense to have the fictitious particle right in between them: the system is symmetric.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, the last part of the above equation tells us: first go to $m_1$ and then, 'walk' a fraction $\\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $ of the line connecting $m_1$ and $m_2$. If you have done that, you are at position $\\vec{R}$.  \n",
    "Note: if $m_1 = m_2$ this recipe indeed brings us right between the two particles.  \n",

    "We call this position the **center of mass**, or CM for short. Reason: if we look at the response of our two particle system to the forces, it is as if there is a particle $M$ at position $\\vec{R}$ that has all the momentum of the system.\n",

However, a numerical approach can be done with great success. Moreover, current computers are so powerful that the system can contain hundred, thousands of particles up to billions depending on the type or particle-particle interaction. \n",

    "All kind of computational techniques have been developed and various averaging techniques are employed in statistical techniques are introduced from the start. the reason is often, that a particular 'realisation' of all positions and velocities of all particles is needed nor sought for. A system is at its macro level described by averaged properties, the exact location of the individual atoms is not needed. You will find applications in cosmology all the way to molecular dynamics, trying to simulate the behavior of proteins or pharmaceuticals. \n",
