```{exercise} Connected events &#127798;
:label: 15.1

Consider the following pairs of events and determine whether they are time like, space like or light like connected.

a. E1: $(ct_1, x_1) = (1,0)$ and E2: $(ct_2, x_2) = (0,1)$  
b. E3: $(ct_3, x_3) = (1,3)$ and E4: $(ct_4, x_4) = (-2,1)$  
c. E5: $(ct_5, x_5) = (1,2)$ and E6: $(ct_6, x_6) = (3,4)$  

$S'$ travels at $V/c = 12/13$ in the positive $x$-direction with respect to $S$. Their clocks are synchronized when their origins coincide.

d. Answer the same questions, but now from the perspective of $S'$.

```

```{exercise}
:label: 15.2

In the frame of $S$ a laser is placed at $(x_1,y_1,z_1) = (4,0,0)$. A receiver is located at $(x_2,y_2,z_2) = (0,3,0)$. At $ct=0$ the laser fires a light puls towards the receiver.

Find the events "pulse sent" and "pulse received" and determine the distance between the two events.

Secondly, an observer $S'$ moves with $V/c = 4/5$ with respect to $S$. The velocity points in the positive $x$-direction. Both observers have their $x$ resp. $x'$ axis aligned and their clocks synchronized: $ct' = ct = 0$ when $x' = x = 0$.

Find the events for $S'$ and show that the same distance is found between the two events.

```

```{exercise}
:label: 15.3

Observer $S'$ moves at a constant velocity of $V/c = 12/13$ with respect to $S$. They have aligned their axes and synchronized their clocks in the usual way.

Consider the two events $E1: (ct_1,x_1) = (3,3)$ and $E2: (ct_2,x_2)= (4,5)$

a.  Compute the distance between the two events, $\Delta s^2$, according to S.  
b.  Compute the event coordinates according to $S'$.  
c.  Compute $\Delta s'^2$ and convince yourself that this is of course equal to $\Delta s^2$.

```

```{exercise}
:label: 15.4

Observer $S'$ moves at a constant velocity of $V/c = 3/5$ with respect to $S$. They have aligned their axes and synchronized their clocks in the usually way. In the world of $S'$ the following events happen:

E0: $(ct'_0, x'_0)=(0,0)$ preparation is made to send a signal;  
E1: $(ct'_1, x'_1)=(1,0)$ a light signal is send over the positive $x'$ axis;  
E2: $(ct'_2, x'_2)=(2,1)$ the signal is received;  
E3: $(ct'_3, x'_3)=(3,1)$ the signal is processed and a second one is emitted in the negative $x'$ direction;  
E4: $(ct'_4, x'_4)=(4,0)$ the signal is received;  
E5: $(ct'_5, x'_5)=(5,0)$ the signal is processed.

Find the corresponding $(ct,x)$ coordinates according to $S$.
Draw the events in two diagrams. The first one has both $ct$ and $ct'$ as the vertical axis and $x$ and $x'$ as the horizontal axis. The second on is a Minkowski diagram from the perspective of $S$.

```


```{exercise}
:label: 15.5

A Space Ship, with $S'$ on board, is moving at $V/c = 3/5$ with respect to Mission Control (where $S$ is located) on earth. Both $S$ and $S'$ have aligned their axes and synchronized their clocks in the usual way. 

Mission control receives at $t=1.7 ls$ images from the impact of a meteorite on the moon. The distance from Mission Control to the moon is 1.2ls (according to $S$). This event E1. Event E2 is the impact itself (that is where and when of the impact), Event 3 is the receiving of images of the impact by $S'$. Of course, images travel in space at the speed of light.

a.  Lorentz transform the events to $S'$.
b.  Find the position of $S'$ at the time of the three events according to $S$. This provides additional events.
c.  Make a $(ct,x)$ diagram in which you plot all the above events. Draw the the world line of $S'$ in the diagram.
d.  Do the same but now for $S'$.
e.  Make a Minkowski diagram (from the perspective of $S$) and draw the grid-lines of $S'$ for the events E1 and E2.

a. E1: $(ct_1, x_1) = (1,0)$ and E2: $(ct_2, x_2) = (0,1)$  
$$\rightarrow \Delta s_{12}^2 = (1-0)^2 - (0-1)^2 = 0 \text{ light like}$$
b. E3: $(ct_3, x_3) = (1,3)$ and E4: $(ct_4, x_4) = (-2,1)$  
$$\rightarrow \Delta s_{34}^2 = (1+2)^2 - (3-1)^2 = 5 \text{ time like}$$
c. E5: $(ct_5, x_5) = (1,2)$ and E6: $(ct_6, x_6) = (3,4)$  
$$\rightarrow \Delta s_{56}^2 = (1-3)^2 - (2-4)^2 = 0 \text{ light like}$$

d. Transform to $S'$: $V/c = 12/13 \rightarrow \gamma = 13/5$
$$\begin{split}
ct' &= \gamma \left ( ct - \frac{V}{c} x \right ) \\
x &= \gamma \left ( x - \frac{V}{c} ct \right )
\end{split}$$

E1: $(ct'_1, x'_1) = (13/5,-12/5)$ and E2: $(ct_2, x_2) = (-12/5,13/5)$

$$\rightarrow \Delta s^{'2}_{12} = (13/5+12/5)^2 - (-12/5-13/5)^2 = 0 \text{ light like} $$

E3: $(ct'_3, x'_3) = (-23/5,27/5)$ and E4: $(ct_4, x_4) = (-38/5,37/5)$  
$$\begin{split}
\rightarrow \Delta s^{'2}_{34} &= (-23/5+38/5)^2 - (27/5-37/5)^2 \\ 
&= 225/25 - 100/25 = 5 \text{ time like}
\end{split}$$
E5: $(ct'_5, x'_5) = (-11/5,14/5)$ and E6: $(ct'_6, x'_6) = (-9/5,16/5)$  
$$\rightarrow \Delta s^{'2}_{56} = (-11/5+9/5)^2 - (14/5-16/5)^2 = 0 \text{ light like}$$

Of course, for all cases we find $\Delta s'^2 = \Delta s^2 $: distance defined according to our Minkowski inproduct is a Lorentz invariant, i.e. the same for all inertial observers.

For $S$:
$$ E1: (ct_1, x_1, y_1, z_1) = (0,4,0,0)$$
$$ E2: (ct_2, x_2, y_2, z_2) = (5,0,3,0)$$
$$\delta s^2_{12} = (0-5)^2 - (4-0)^2 - (0-3)^2 - (0-0)^2 = 0 $$
light-like of course, as we deal with a light pulse.

For $S'$: LT with $V/c = 4/5 \rightarrow \gamma = 5/3$
$$\begin{split}
ct' &= \frac{5}{3} \left ( ct - \frac{4}{5}x \right ) \\
x' &= \frac{5}{3} \left ( x - \frac{4}{5}ct \right ) \\
y' &= y \\
z' &= z
\end{split}$$

Thus:
$$ E1: (ct'_1, x'_1, y'_1, z'_1) = (-16/3,20/3,0,0)$$
$$ E2: (ct'_2, x'_2, y'_2, z'_2) = (25/3,-20/3,3,0)$$
$$\begin{split}
\delta s^{'2}_{12} &= (-16/3-25/3)^2 - (20/3+20/3)^2 - (0-3)^2 - (0-0)^2 \\
&= \frac{41^2}{9} - \frac{40^2}{9} - \frac{81}{9} =0 
\end{split}$$


```

```{solution} 15.3

We start with writing down the LT. As $V/c = 12/13$ we have $\gamma = 13/5$.
Thus, for this case LT reads as:

$$\begin{split}
ct' &= \frac{13}{5} \left ( ct - \frac{12}{13}x \right ) \\
x' &= \frac{13}{5} \left ( x - \frac{12}{13}ct \right )
\end{split}$$

a.  $$\begin{split} 
\Delta s^2 &\equiv (ct_2 - ct_1 )^2 - (x_2 - x_1 )^2 \\
&=(4-3)^2-(5-3)^2 \\
&= -3
\end{split}$$

b.  event E1: 
$$\begin{split}
ct'_1 &= \frac{13}{5} \left ( 3 - \frac{12}{13}3 \right ) = \frac{3}{5} \\
x'_1 &= \frac{13}{5} \left ( 3 - \frac{12}{13}3 \right ) = \frac{3}{5}
\end{split}$$

event E2:
$$\begin{split}
ct'_2 &= \frac{13}{5} \left ( 4 - \frac{12}{13}5 \right ) = -\frac{8}{5} \\
x'_2 &= \frac{13}{5} \left ( 5 - \frac{12}{13}4 \right ) = \frac{17}{5}
\end{split}$$

c.  $$\begin{split} 
\Delta s'^2 &\equiv (ct'_2 - ct'_1 )^2 - (x'_2 - x'_1 )^2 \\
&=(-\frac{8}{5}-\frac{3}{5})^2-(\frac{17}{5}-\frac{3}{5})^2 \\
&= \frac{121}{25} -\frac{196}{25} = -3
\end{split}$$

```

Lorentz Transformation 
$$\begin{split} ct &= \gamma \left ( ct' + \frac{V}{c} x'\right ) \\
x &= \gamma \left ( x' + \frac{V}{c} ct'\right )\\
\text{with } &\frac{V}{c} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ and } \gamma = \frac{5}{4}
\end{split}$$

This gives:

E0: $(ct_0, x_0)=(0,0)$   
E1: $(ct_1, x_1)=(5/4,3/4)$   
E2: $(ct_2, x_2)=(13/4,11/4)$   
E3: $(ct_3, x_3)=(9/2,7/2)$   
E4: $(ct_4, x_4)=(5,3)$   
E5: $(ct_5, x_5)=(25/4,15/4)$

This gives the two required plots.
